This application is built fof UCB'S coding bootcamp challenge #6: a weather dashboard that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. It leverages the OpenWeather API for data.


### Live Application Link 👀

### Built With 🧰
- [x] HTML
- [x] Bootstrap / CSS
- [x] JavasScript
- [x] Moment.js
- [x] OpenWeatherAPI
- [x] Google Fonts

The following was completed:

- Users can query a city and see the day's forecast, in addition to the 5 day forecast that follows
- Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, and UV Index information are all pulled in from the OpenWeatherAPI
- Recent searches are stored and a user can again select a past search to see current information
- The application is reponsive with Bootstrap
- Color coding and icons make the application data easier to interpret


The following potential additions are pending:

- Adding nice icons
- Modal instead of alert for improper input + no blank button display
- Perfecting Mobile Transition
- Cool day/night transition
- Adding additional visuals, like Google SERPs with wind data:
